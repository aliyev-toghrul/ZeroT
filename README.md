# ZeroT — Leveling the Cybersecurity Playing Field for SMEs 🛡️

ZeroT is a mission-driven, AI-native cybersecurity readiness platform designed specifically for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). We bridge the "Security Gap" for businesses that cannot afford a dedicated SOC (Security Operations Center) but face enterprise-level threats.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **ZeroT provides the clarity SMEs need to respond to cyber threats with confidence, turning uncertainty into actionable readiness.**

## 💎 The Problem & Our Solution

| The SME Struggle | The ZeroT Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Ambiguity:** "Is this email a hack or a real invoice?" | **AI Triage:** Instant, plain-language risk assessment. |
| **No Expertise:** Technical jargon causes decision paralysis. | **ZeroT Morphism:** A UI designed for non-technical founders. |
| **Static Data:** Threat data is siloed and hard to find. | **Hybrid Intelligence:** Blending public data (opendata.az) with AI reasoning. |

## 🌟 Core Feature Suite

### 📡 Live OSINT Threat Feed
Our homepage features a real-time ticker simulating data from regional and global threat databases. It provides SMEs with context on the active threat landscape in their specific sector/region.

### 🔍 Hybrid Threat Scanner (VirusTotal for SMEs)
Unlike simple blacklists, our scanner uses **Hybrid Intelligence**:
1. **Database Lookup:** Checks Google Safe Browsing, PhishTank, and URLScan.io.
2. **AI Semantic Analysis:** Gemini Pro analyzes the "logic" of the threat (typosquatting, social engineering).
3. **Plain English Report:** Tells the user exactly *why* something is dangerous without the jargon.

### 💬 ZeroT AI Assistant
A built-in Q&A widget that allows team members to ask security questions 24/7. It follows a strict system prompt to avoid hallucinations and stick to proven security frameworks.

## 🏗️ Hybrid Architecture (Monorepo)

To ensure high performance for the public-facing site and high security for the internal dashboard, ZeroT uses a **Separation of Concerns** architecture:

- **Frontend/Intake (Root):** Built with **Next.js 15**, hosted on **Vercel**. Handles the Landing Page, OSINT Feed, and the Threat Scanner.
- **Core Dashboard (`base44-core/`):** A secure **React 18 + Vite** application. This is where authenticated users (SME Founders) manage their Readiness Score, view incident logs (Response Tasks), and read their Weekly Risk Briefs.
